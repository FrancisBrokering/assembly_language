Lab 2: Simple Data Path

----------------
Discription
In this Lab, we learned how to use multiplexers and registers. I built a register file that contains four 4-bit registers.The value save in the registers will be selected either from the ALU output ot the keypad. The ALU in this system is a 4-bit bitwise right rotation.

Instructions
First press the clear register to reset all register values to 0. Then select 0 or 1 for the store select (0 if keypad input, 1 if ALU output). After selecting which value to store in the registers, use the Write Address switches to select which register you want to store the value. Now use the read register 2 switches to chose which register you want to operate a rotation right command. Use the read register 1 switches to chose how many bits you want to rotate the value by.
