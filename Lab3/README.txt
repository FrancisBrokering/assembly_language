Lab3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

---------------------------
In this lab we used how to code in mips. We created a code that prints out a triangle made of asterisks with a height given by the user input.

instructions
this program runs on MIPS assembler and a runtime simulator, MARS. The code will ask you for a input that is going to be the height of the triangle it prints out.
