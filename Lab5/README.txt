Lab 5: Functions and Graphics
-----------------------------
Description:
This program contains functions that perform graphic operationsn on a small simulated display. First it clears the whole display to a specific color. Next it draws nine solid circles, and at the end it will draw eight unfilled colored circles. We used Bitmap display to display these circles.
-----------------------------
Files
Lab5.asm
This file includes the assembly program code of Lab5 which was written using MARS

Lab5_s20_test.asm
This file is used to display circles on the bimap display. It is not graded
-----------------------------
Instructions:
this program runs on MIPS assembler and a runtime simulator, MARS. There are no place to provide inputs but you can change colors of the circle by editing the lab5_s20_test.asm file and provide differnt colors.
You will need to use bitmap display to display the circles. Use the 128 x 128 demention and select 0xffff0000 (memory map) as the base address for display.
